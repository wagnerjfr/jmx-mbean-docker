# Managing Java applications running in Docker containers using JMX
[Java Management Extensions (JMX) framework](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html) is a Java technology that provides tools for managing and monitoring Java applications. It allows developers to instrument Java code to expose metrics, manage application resources, and control application behavior remotely.

Docker, on the other hand, is a popular containerization platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can then be deployed consistently across different environments, from development to production, without worrying about underlying infrastructure differences.

In this project, we explore how to leverage the JMX framework to effectively manage and monitor Java applications running within Docker containers.
